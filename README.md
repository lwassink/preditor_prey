# preditor_prey

A project to model predator-prey levels
predator_prey.py runs the  simulation. Run predator_prey.py -h for information on options. No arguments are required. It does use the matplotlib library, so you'll need to download that to run it.
I mainly used it to get used to matplotlib and also the argparse library.
It also is somewhat intelegent about file saving.
